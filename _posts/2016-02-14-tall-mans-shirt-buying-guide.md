title: Buying Trousers for the Taller Gent

I recently took a road trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

On the way out of town my friends and I stopped for a bit of shopping.

After having lived in a hot climate for many years I had no long sleeved shirts to wear (there is no winter in the jungle).

But I didn’t end up buying much of anything…

I was struck by this one Chinese woman working in a shoe store.

I watched the Chinese woman hustle for business and I watched the American store clerks lose my business.

The Chinese woman was hard at work trying to make a sale.

She kept saying “firty person off (30% off)” and working to close the deal.

In the other shops, the women and girls working the register don’t even bother to look up at you, let alone try to hustle and make a sale, but the Chinese woman was working like a dog to close the deal.

I would bet ten thousand dollars on two things:

The Chinese woman works (or would work) 16 hours per day, 7 days per week and doesn’t complain
The American women and girls take any day off they possibly can and they complain about low pay
(Don’t be a fool and take the bet, I will win).

After having lived in China for one year I have no great respect for them, but it is undeniable that they work long and hard.

And I respect all people on God’s green earth who work long and hard without complaint.

So for you killers and real-dealers, here are 18 Ways to Win Big in Business…
(like the Chinese workhorse and not like the American lazy girls.)

1) Days off are for losers

I said it and you read it – days off are for LOSERS.

You will never win big on your day off. You don’t stand a chance of winning a race you don’t show up to.

You will never hear a winner in business say “Sorry, can’t. It’s Saturday, my day off. Call my office on Monday“.

You don’t get days off until you earn days off and you don’t earn days off within the first 5 years in business.

Big business takes big hours, if you don’t work them someone else will.

I will. The Chinese woman offering firty person off will.

The Chinese woman probably built a house for her parents in China with the money she made selling shoes in America.

The American girls no doubt get money from dad to supplement their lack of work ethic.

Here’s the rule: If you’re awake, you’re working.

Always be “on”.

I told you I was “shopping” but I was actually writing this article on my cellular phone.
